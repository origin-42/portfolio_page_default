# React Portfolio

Hello, I'm a web developer from Australia. Mostly focused around MERN MVC currently for building web applications. I've mostly began developing web application in the beginning on 2022 with prior years experience using vanilla JavaScript and some associated libraries, including JQuery. I'll likely look into TypeScript eventually.
